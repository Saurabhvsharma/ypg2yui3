# Young Person's Guide to YUI3

This is a gentle introduction to YUI3. It does make a few assumptions-

* You have a passing knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS
* A basic idea of how the web works
* Know how to install things on your computer

## Getting started

### What you're need

The typical web developer setup is a computer, a web browser, a text editor and a web server.
More specifially you can use either a Linux box, a Mac, Windows PC, or even a Raspberry Pi. You'll also
need a web browser (e.g. Firefox), an editor (e.g. Adobe Brackets or Scripted Editor), 
and the web server (e.g. httpster, Apache or NginX).  I happen to use a Mac, Firefox or Chrome web browser, 
Adobe Brackets and httpster as my webserver. My setup should run equally well on a Mac or Windows PC. I
also have been known to use a Raspberry Pi, Firefox (iceweasel), Scripted Editor and httpster.


### Using my setup

You only need the general setup to follow along but if you'd like to use what I used these instructions
are for you.

1) Turn on your computer :-)
2) Download and install the latest [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org), click on the download button and follow the instructions
3) Install Adobe Brackets
4) Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org), click the download button and follow the instructions
5) [httpster](https://github.com/SimbCo/httpster), follow the instructions in the "README.md"
