# [Young Persons Guide to YUI3](Young-Persons-Guide-to-YUI3)

by R. S. Doiel, <rsdoiel@gmail.com>

This is a gentle introduction to [YUI3][]. It does make a few assumptions-

* You have a basic knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS
* A basic idea of how the web works

For those who might be familiar with jQuery I'll point out the similarities
to speed you along.

For a much more complete look at YUI3 I recommend [Evan Goer](http://www.goer.org/)'s
[YUI3 Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920013303.do). It has been the goto
text for bootstrapping my understanding of YUI3. It is also a handy set of recipes
for YUI3's practical application.  Additionally the [YUILibrary](http://yuilibrary.com)
website has the canonical documentation and you can read the source for YUI3 at
[Github](https://github.com/yui/yui3) under yui/yui3.

A note about using Google Search for learning YUI3. Right now, May 2013, the Google's search
algorhythm still ranks legacy YUI2 documentation higher than YUI3.  This can easily lead
to confusion. I've found seaching Stackexchange and Google Groups more helpful. Additionally
there is an active IRC community on irc.freeenode.net under #yui.
