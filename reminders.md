### Should you use YUI for that?

While _YUI3_ is a very good library it is easy to get carried away. 
Here's some heuristic in deciding when to use _YUI3_ (or really any 
JavaScript at all)

- If it is structure then use HTML
- If it is visual look and feel or layout trying solving with CSS
- If it is behavior use JavaScript if you can not achieve it in HTML and CSS
- If you can solve it simply in plain JavaScript then do so. 
- If it is more complicated or can benefit from modularization consider _YUI3_
